# Array-Sorting-Algorithm
A sorting algorithm for arrays implemented with javascript.


simple function that returns an array of numbers arranged from lowest to highest regardless of duplicity or number of times a particular number occurs.


```javascript
arr = [1,4,5,3,6,6,7,6,5,6,3,4,6,4];
console.log(sort(arr));
```

would return 
[ 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7 ]
